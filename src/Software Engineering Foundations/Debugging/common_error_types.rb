# SyntaxError
# A SyntaxError results from incorrectly structuring our code.
# SyntaxError because we need to have a value to assign
my_variable =     

# NameError
# A NameError results from referring to a variable or method name that has not been defined:
my_variable = 42
p my_variabel # NameError because this name has not been defined previously

# NoMethodError
# A NoMethodError results from referring to an undefined method. 
# It is considered a special instance of a NameError:
def say_hello(name)
  p "hi " + name
end

hello("world")  # NoMethodError because `hello` is not a defined method

# ArgumentError
# A ArgumentError results from incorrectly specifying arguments for a method call. 
# Typically this means passing too little or too many arguments
def say_hello(first_name, last_name)
p "hi " + first_name + " " + last_name
end

say_hello("world")  # ArgumentError because we gave 1 arg, but `say_hello` expects 2 args

# TypeError
# A TypeError results from performing an operation with incompatible data types:
5 + "spaghetti" # TypeError because we cannot add a Integer and a String together
